# Example data structure

[name, genre, year, scene, clip, chunk, imgs, Eimage, Elocation, Evideo, Edepth]

# Features 
Process

Load csv

For each sample:
    metadata = [name, genre, year, scene, clip, chunk]
    embeddings = [Eimage, Elocation, Evideo, Edepth]

for img in Eimage:
    aggregation.append(Eimage)
    stack aggregation

Work for Monday

1. Fix dataloader to load individual csv files. Must have the option for number of frames etc. 
2. Stack frames in dataloader and return - look for faster solution / using yield or similiar in meantime. 
3. Explore options for audio embedding extraction
4. Add an option for working with frames temporaly at an even finer grained level 
5. Consider the multiple crop option also as an alternative.
